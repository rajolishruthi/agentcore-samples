# Sector Rotation Skill

Use this skill when a user asks about sector allocation, where to rotate capital, which sectors to favor or avoid, or how to position a portfolio across sectors.

## Required workflow

1. Retrieve the overall market overview using `get_market_overview`.
2. Retrieve detailed data for the following sectors using `get_sector_data` for each: technology, healthcare, financials, energy, consumer_staples, consumer_discretionary.
3. Search for macroeconomic news using `search_news` with a query covering rates, inflation, and GDP. Keep the runtime's default news source.
4. Rank sectors by today's performance and YTD trend direction.
5. Classify each sector as **Overweight**, **Neutral**, or **Underweight** based on:
   - Today's performance relative to the broad market
   - Outlook field from sector data
   - Macro backdrop (rate environment, growth signals)
6. Identify the top 2 sectors to overweight and the bottom 2 to underweight.
7. Provide a rotation rationale (2–3 sentences) explaining the macro driver.

## Output Format
