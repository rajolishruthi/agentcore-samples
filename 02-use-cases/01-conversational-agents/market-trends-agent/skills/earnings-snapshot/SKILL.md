# Earnings Snapshot Skill

Use this skill when a user asks about a company's earnings, valuation metrics, fundamentals, whether a stock is cheap or expensive, or how recent results compared to expectations.

## Required workflow

1. Retrieve stock data using `get_stock_data` for the requested symbol.
2. Search for earnings-related news by calling `search_news(query)` with exactly one argument: a query that includes the symbol, company name, and `earnings`. Do not pass `news_source`; keep the runtime default.
3. Extract the following fundamental metrics from stock data:
   - P/E ratio (compare to sector average: Technology ~34x, Healthcare ~22x, Financials ~13x, Energy ~14x, Consumer Discretionary ~30x, Consumer Staples ~25x)
   - Dividend yield (0% = growth stock; >2% = income stock)
   - Market cap tier (Mega >$1T, Large $100B-$1T, Mid $10B-$100B)
4. Assess valuation:
   - P/E > 1.3× sector average → **Premium** (growth priced in)
   - P/E within 0.7×–1.3× sector average → **Fair Value**
   - P/E < 0.7× sector average → **Discount** (value opportunity or value trap)
5. Identify the most relevant earnings headline from news results.
6. Provide a 2-sentence earnings outlook.
